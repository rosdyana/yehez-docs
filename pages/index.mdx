# Yehez Docs

This is my personal library. It feels like I put my thoughts here like a second brain. Its content actually is not for everyone due to it is very opinionated. But you can access my site and make it as a reference.

I felt exhausted when I have to repeatedly search the same things on Google. So I ask myself, why not I'm making my own personal docs site so I can put on any bookmarks or notes for myself.

If you've found that there're some things that are outdated or may be useful for me too, let me know by sending them to my  <a href="mailto: yehezkiel.gunawan28@gmail.com">email</a>.
